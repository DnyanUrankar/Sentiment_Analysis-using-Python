# Sentiment_Analysis-using-Python

What is sentiment analysis?

Sentiment analysis is a technique that detects the underlying sentiment in a piece of text.
It is the process of classifying text as either positive, negative, or neutral. Machine learning techniques are used to evaluate a piece of text and determine the sentiment behind it.

The Analysis

I will guide you through the end to end process of performing sentiment analysis on a large amount of data.
We will be using the Reviews.csv file from Kaggleâ€™s Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset to perform the analysis.
I use a Jupyter Notebook for all analysis and visualization, but any Python IDE will do the job.
